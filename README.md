- 👋 Hi, I’m @electricxray
- 👀 I’m interested in homelabbing and hosting services.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, linux, and openshift.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much at this time, I don't feel I'm strong enough to help much.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a firefighter since 2010, my degree is in Psychology, and I just enjoy doing cool stuff with technology of all kinds.
